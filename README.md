<b>Game "Puzzle 15" running via Linux terminal</b>

<hr>

This game was written with pure C++ experience some years ago when I just started to learn it. This repository could be deleted but let it stay. After all it is still working and looking fun enough.

While running the terminal is swiched to direct mode without need to use "Enter" key

Try to put the letters one by one with <b>`up` `down` `left`</b> and <b>`right`</b> keys
