<b>Game "Puzzle 15" running via Linux terminal</b>

<hr>

This game was written without any experience in C++ some years ago when I just started to learn myself coding. This repository could be deleted but let it stay. After all it is still working and looking fun.

While running the terminal is swiched to direct mode without need to use "Enter" key

Try to put the letters one by one with <b>`up` `down` `left`</b> and <b>`right`</b> keys

Use `build.sh` and `run.sh` from the source folder to compile and run the application
